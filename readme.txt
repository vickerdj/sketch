The PrivateAssemblies folder is designed to contain managed assemblies that run within the development environment but are not intended to be called from user code. These assemblies are not displayed in the Project Add References dialog box or the Object Browser's Component Selector dialog box. For example, managed add-ins or designers should be installed in this directory.
